            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I decided to go back to school, it was immediately clear to me that I stood out in my classrooms. There have been many moments where the isolation almost pushed me to stop the degree all together. As a result, it has been extremely important to me to try to create community for the marginalized members of my degree program.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I became involved with various Women in Computer Science and Women in Engineering groups on campus. Through this involvement, I pitched and organized a Women in Tech Panel for the York community. I also moderated this panel.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning and moderating a panel was brand new territory for me. I really took advantage of my network from my past work experience to find speakers for the panel (being mindful of going beyond my friends and acquaintances, to ensure the panel was diverse in perspective and background). My network was also very helpful in providing tips and tricks for running a successful panel.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation and support from my peers really helped the event go successfully. There was a panelists that almost every audience member could relate to, and the panelists were well prepared ahead of time (I had many phone calls with them, as well as provided the questions a week in advance).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moderating this discussion was so enjoyable for me. I was nervous, but ultimately dove into the conversation prepared and excited to hear from my panelists about their experiences. I put myself in the mind of an audience member, and tried to lead the conversation into the direction that I thought the audience would be interested in hearing. Ultimately, the comments and discussions among attendees after the panel made me feel like the event was a success. One first year engineering student came up to me and excitedly exclaimed “I finally asked a question in my class today! This panel makes me want to ask more.” I’m really proud of how this panel went! <br><br></div>
