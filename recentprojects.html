      <h2>Q: How could you link a personal website without a project page?!</h2>

      <h3>A: Fair point! Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">MVP (Minimal Viable Product)</a> framework, and my favourite children's book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/887573.Something_From_Nothing" target="_blank">Something From Nothing</a>, it's better to put up something, than nothing! My projects are briefly touched on in my resume, and I'm happy to chat about them in interview or over the phone. In the mean time, I hope you enjoy my favourite GIF below.</h3>
